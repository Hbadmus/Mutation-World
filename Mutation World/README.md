# Mutation World - Final Project for Game Programming Class

This project is a game developed as a final project for my game programming class, initially created in collaboration with a team of classmates. Since completing the class, I’ve taken on the project solo, focusing on expanding, cleaning, and polishing the game.

### Overview

The game currently features one level that has undergone extensive updates to improve gameplay mechanics, visuals, and user experience. Although the game is not fully complete, the first level showcases newly implemented functionality to give a glimpse of the improvements and the direction of the project.
