# Mutation World - Final Project for Game Programming Class

This project is a game developed as a final project for my game programming class, initially created in collaboration with a team of classmates. Since completing the class, I’ve taken on the project solo, focusing on expanding, cleaning, and polishing the game.

### Overview

The game currently features one level that has undergone extensive updates to improve gameplay mechanics, visuals, and user experience. Although the game is not fully complete, the first level showcases newly implemented functionality to give a glimpse of the improvements and the direction of the project.

## Current Features

- **Core Gameplay**: *Mutation World* is a survival exploration game where players choose one of two unique characters, each with specialized abilities, to battle through a mutated, post-apocalyptic world. Core mechanics include combat using unique character abilities, resource management, exploration across five dangerous maps, and strategic boss fights at the end of each level. Players must balance offense, survival, and resource collection to progress through the game’s escalating challenges.
- **Level 1**: Includes primary gameplay and showcases updated features.

## Newly Implemented Features

These updates have been added to improve player experience and gameplay quality in Level 1:

-Enhanced Movement: Player movement is now faster and smoother.
-Zombie Cap: Limited to 30 zombies to reduce lag and avoid overwhelming players.
-Improved Bullet Collision: Bullets now hit only one zombie instead of passing through multiple.
-Hitbox Adjustments: Fixed small hitbox issues for zombies.
-Fiona’s/Jack's Ability Fixes:
--Main: Now fires a piercing arrow instead of marking enemies in red.
--Ultimate: Fires a wide spread of arrows.
--Passive: Increased speed for Fiona, and Jack now has damage mitigation.
-Medkit Drops: Zombies drop one medkit at random, instead of multiple.
-UI Tweaks: Adjustments to elements like zombie health bars.
-Realistic Zombie Tracking: Improved field of view and vicinity range so zombies realistically pursue players around corners.

3. **Refined Mechanics**: Improved character movement, interaction, and responsiveness for a more polished feel.
